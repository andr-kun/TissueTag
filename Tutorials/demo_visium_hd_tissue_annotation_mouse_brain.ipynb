    "# 🧭 Compute Spatial Axes Between Anatomical Landmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "To better capture spatial organization within complex brain regions, we calculate **continuous spatial axes** that represent each spot’s position **relative to two anatomical landmarks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📐 Axis Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `tt.calculate_axis_2p()` function, we generate **directional, normalized spatial gradients** between selected anatomical regions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pia_to_wm`: Measures depth along the **cortical column**, from the pia surface to underlying white matter.\n",
    "- `olf_to_wm`: Captures positioning along the **olfactory–white matter axis**, useful for modeling transitions in **striatal** regions.\n",
    "- `iso_to_wm`: Represents spatial location **within the isocortex**, from the cortical-corpus callosum interface as a 0 point.\n",
    "- `hip_to_den`: Describes a spatial axis within the **hippocampus**, spanning from hippocampal tissue toward the **dentate gyrus**.  \n",
    "  *(This one is exploratory and not grounded in known biological gradients—just for fun!) 😉\n",
    "\n",
    "Each computed axis is added as a new column in `adata.obs`, enabling further stratification, visualization, and spatial modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Contextual Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve specificity and interpretability, we apply **region-aware masking** to restrict each spatial axis to its relevant anatomical context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pia_to_wm` is retained only in **isocortex** or **layer_1**\n",
    "- Spots located far from both **pia** and **white matter** (> ~1000 microns\\*) are excluded\n",
    "- `olf_to_wm` is restricted to the **striatum**\n",
    "- `iso_to_wm` is limited to **isocortex** and **white matter**, and further filtered to spots within ~300 microns\\* of either structure\n",
    "- `hip_to_den` is retained only in **hippocampus** or **dentate gyrus**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* _Note:_ These distances are calculated from the **mean distance to a set of nearby points (neighborhood)**, not from a single closest spot.  \n",
    "If you need distances that reflect the **exact distance to the single nearest spot**, set `nhood_size=1` when computing distances.  \n",
    "However, keep in mind that setting `nhood_size=1` may limit your ability to calculate smooth spatial axes **within structures**—as done in `iso_to_wm` and `hip_to_den`.\n",
